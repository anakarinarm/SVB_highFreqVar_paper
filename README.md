**This repository is divided into:**

* **figures/**  notebooks used to generate figures in the paper

* **postprocessing/** code used to calculate energy contributions and vertical velocity variance

* **MITgcm_config**  configuration files needed to reproduce our MITgcm runs.

All the python libraries needed to run the scripts and notebooks are listed in the the yaml file ```SVB.yml``` for the conda envirnoment ```SVB```.

Selected variables of the model output can be downloaded here:
