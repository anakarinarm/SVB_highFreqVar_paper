### Submitted to JGR-Oceans
### Notebooks, code and data

This repository is divided into:

**figures/**  notebooks used to generate figures in the paper

**postprocessing/** code used to calculate energy contributions and vertical velocity variance

**MITgcm_config**  input files (data and bathymetry files) needed to reproduce our MITgcm runs.

All the python libraries needed to run the scripts and notebooks are listed in the the yaml file ````SVB.yml``` for the conda envirnoment ```SVB````.
