## High-frequency variability induced in the Southern California Bight by a wind event in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay, Baja California
### Submitted to JGR-Oceans
### Notebooks, code and data used in Ramos-Musalem et al. 2023.

This repository is divided into:

**figures/**  notebooks used to generate figures in the paper

**postprocessing/** code used to calculate energy contributions and vertical velocity variance

**MITgcm**  input files (data and bathymetry files) needed to reproduce our MITgcm runs.
